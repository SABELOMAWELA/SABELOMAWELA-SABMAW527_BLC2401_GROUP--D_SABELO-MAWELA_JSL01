# SABELOMAWELA-SABMAW527_BLC2401_GROUP--D_SABELO-MAWELA_JSL01
## Validation Logic

The input is checked to see if it matches the format pet_XXXXYYYYZ,

where: pet_ is a fixed prefix.
XXXX represents a pet code.
YYYY represents a year, which must be between 2000 and 2030.
Z represents an initial letter for the pet's name, which must be a capital letter.
If the input matches the format, the validation result is set to "valid syntax" with a green checkmark emoji.
If the input does not match the format, the validation result is set to "invalid syntax" with a red cross emoji.
